Files I wrote in were utilityfunction.py (in SampleSignal) and generate_indicators.py
(also in SampleSignal). The first contains utilities I used for graphing and
creating P&L dataframes. generate_indicators.py contains most of the logic I used for producing
indicators or signals. The exploration is mainly contained within Dry_run_presentation.ipynb 
(also in the same directory) - here you can find graphs that I made to test certain ideas or 
visualize the performance of indicators.
