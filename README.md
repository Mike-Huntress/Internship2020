# Setup Steps

First, you need to setup some tools/environments, and then once the project is setup, there are some data initialization steps.

## Environments and Tools:
To ensure this setup works on everyone's particular machine configuration, we're going to run this project our of a
virtual box, an open source Oracle project that let's you run any operating system (we'll all be using Linux) and
software on a virtual machine. For anyone who finds the small annoyances of using Linux (learning a new tool) from a
virtual machine (depending on your physical machine, there may be a bit of a lag) too much to bear, you can run this
project from your local machine just fine but you may have to sort through some setup steps on your own.


### Environment A. To Get Virtual Box Implementation Setup:
We're going to download software to run virtual boxes, a template of a virtual box with the OS we're all going to use
on it, then install some software on that box.


#### Download VirtualBox:
1. Go here and download appropriate verison for your OS:
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

#### VirtualBox Setup:
1. Download Ubuntu VDI image:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/osboxes/files/v/vb/55-U-u/20.04/Ubnt-20.04-VB-64bit.7z/download
2. Note: You may first need to extract the download with a program like 7zip or TheUnarchiver. Anything that'll extract
   a 7Zip file should work
3. Follow the section "How to attach/configure image with VirtualBox?" listed here:
    https://www.osboxes.org/guide/ with the following caveats
    a. When configuring RAM (memory), set to at least 2048
    b. When configuring display/video settings, set video memory to max (128 MB)
    c. Do not change any network card settings

#### OS setup
1. Run VirtualBox, select the virtual machine you just setup (click green start arrow)
2. Logon with password "osboxes.org"
3. Follow the section "How to install Guest Additions" listed here:
    https://www.osboxes.org/guide/

#### Software installation:
These steps look a lot like the steps provided below to setup and run locally, but are specific to the linux
environment running on the virtual box.

###### Update the OS:
1. Launch the terminal
2. Run: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
3. Restart your virtual box (restart)

###### Install git - version control software
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `sudo apt install git`

###### Install pycharm - IDE for python
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic`

###### Install Anaconda python packages and python
1. Download the Anaconda bundle here, which includes python 3, and some other tools we'll use:
   https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Open the terminal and run: `pip3 install conda`
3. From the terminal run: `conda install python=3.6`

###### Download project from github
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `git clone https://github.com/Mike-Huntress/Internship2020.git`
3. Run: `git cd /home/osboxes/Internship2020` [this is where you just cloned to]
4. Run: `git checkout -b bondSignal_FirstName.LastName`
5. Run: `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`
6. Run: `git push`
Now you'll be working from your own branch. Commit regularly. If something happened to your virtual environment and all
your local files got deleted, that would suck. Commit and push often. From within pycharm, you can use ctrl+k to commit
and push.

###### Setup Python/Jupyter path
1. From terminal, run: `echo 'export JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=/home/osboxes/Internship2020' >> ~/.bashrc`

###### Build required python library versions
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `cd /home/osboxes/Internship2020`
3. Run: `sudo -H pip3 install -U pipenv`
4. Run: `pipenv shell`
5. Run: `pipenv install`
Note, after running `pipenv shell`, the terminal will return some text, including a directory path, e.g.:
 /home/osboxes/.local/share/virtualenvs/Internship2020-9Y4UyjGC/bin/activate



###### Final Step: Ensure PyCharm is running the right python interpreter
1. Open PyCharm and open the project we cloned from githib (Internship2020)
2. You may see a yellow ribbon at the top that says no interpreter is setup. If so, select "pipenv interpreter" if
   that's an option. Give it a minute to index your code
3. If that doesn't happen:
   -Go to Preferences -> Project -> Project Interpreter
     -Select the settings button
     -Click "add" and select the System Interpreter option in the right panel
     -Then in the directory menu that appears select the directory
      path the terminal/command line returned to you in step 3, e.g.
      ï»¿/home/osboxes/.local/share/virtualenvs/Internship2020-9Y4UyjGC/bin/activate

    - You can check this is working by running any script in pyCharm. At the top of the pyCharm terminal will
      show the interpreter and the file run. E.g.:
      /home/osboxes/.local/share/virtualenvs/Internship2020-9Y4UyjGC/bin/python3.6  ...
      /home/osboxes/PycharmProjects/BWInternship2020/BasicSetup/CountryMetaData.py

You should be done. Move on to



### Environment B. To Get Local Version Implementation Setup:
We need to do three things to get going:
1. Make sure you have the right verison of python installed
2. Make sure you have the right packages setup in a virtual environment designed to ensure all code is compatible
3. Pull the project from github
4. Setup an IDE to make development easier

#### Step 1:Install Python/ Anaconda bundle
First, make sure you have python 3 installed. Download the Anaconda bundle here, which includes python 3, and some
other tools we'll use: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

#### Step 2a: Download Git
If you don't have git, you need to download it: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Use the defaults for installation.

#### Step 2b: Download github repo
To download this from github, go to your terminal command prompt and type:
git clone https://github.com/Mike-Huntress/Intership2020.git
- This will create a copy of project in your local directory.
- Set the working directory to the newly checkouted out code with:
 cd [put the path to the newly checked out code here]
- Once you've done that, you should create your own development branch to work on with:
 git checkout -b bondSignal_[FirstnameLastname]
- When it comes time to commit your code, you can commit with these commands:
 git commit -m "Your commit message"   , followed by
 git push   , which will push your code to the github server on your new branch

#### Step 3: Setup Python package dependencies
To make sure your local version of python and the associated packages are compatible with utilities we've
made to make this work easier, you're going to need to spin up a python virtual environment with pipenv,
a virtual environment and package manager. As part of your Anaconda download, a piece of package management
software called pip was installed that we're going to run from your terminal/ command line. We're going to
it to fetch some other tools that will help manage our packages more cleanly.

*If using a MacOS/ Linux OS, run this in the terminal/command line:
sudo -H pip install -U pipenv
*If using a windows machine, open the Anaconda powershell (should be an available program) and run
pip install pipenv
*In either environment, then do:
cd [path to the project we just cloned in step 2]
pipenv shell
pipenv install
*There's a chance it may tell you you don't have python 3.6. If so, just type:
conda install python=3.6
pipenv install

After running "pipenv shell", the terminal will return some text, including a directory path, e.g.:
/Users/michaelhuntress/.local/share/virtualenvs/BWInternship2020-qGgbmmCS/bin/activate

Save this path. This new "virtual environment" is a container that will house the right interpreter (python
version), and associated packages to use in this project. It's out of here we're going to run out code.

#### Step 4: Setup IDE
Next, we're going to go get an IDE (integrated development environment), which will make it easier to write
code in. There are many, and you're welcome to use a different one, but I like this one, PyCharm
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac

Download the community version.

- Once you've done this, open an existing project from the directory where we cloned the project code.
- Now we need to tell it to run the python interpreter out of the virtual environemnt we created in step 3:
  - Go to Preferences -> Project -> Project Interpreter
  - Select the settings button
  - Click "add" and select the System Interpreter option in the right panel
  - Then in the directory menu that appears select the directory
   path the terminal/command line returned to you in step 3, e.g.
    /Users/michaelhuntress/.local/share/virtualenvs/BWInternship2020-qGgbmmCS/bin/activate

- You can check this is working by running any script in pyCharm. At the top of the pyCharm terminal will
  show the interpreter and the file run. E.g.:
  /Users/michaelhuntress/.local/share/virtualenvs/BWInternship2020-qGgbmmCS/bin/python3.6 ...
  /Users/michaelhuntress/PycharmProjects/BWInternship2020/BasicSetup/CountryMetaData.py

  So here, for instance, I see it's running out of my virtual environment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Data Initialization Steps
You need to perform a few initial setup steps.You'll need to:
1. Write your data stream (Eikon) credentials to a local file
2. Create a country metadata file that will also be stored locally (you'll use this over and over)
3. Pull an initial batch of data and write to a local file where you can quickly and easily pull from
4. Make sure you can run Jupyter notebooks from your virtual environment




### Step 1: Write credentials to local file
You should have received an Eikon/DataStream username and password. Open up Credentials.py in the
the BasicSetup package and fill out the parameters for "Your Username" and "Your Password" with the
appripriate information.
e.g.:
DataSourceCredentials().addCredentials("datastream", "Your Username", "Your Password")

You should see a folder called .ConfigKeys get written to your user directory with a file called user.config.ini in it.
Once you do this you won't need to worry about passing your username and password to the Eikon/DataStream API to
fetch data again

### Step 2: Create country metadata file
Open the CountryMetaData.py file in the BasicSetpu package and run this. That's all you need to do, and you only need
to do it once. Thiswill write a local folder to your user directory called  .dataLib with a file called
countryMetaData.ini

### Step 3: Fetch data from Eikon/DataStream API and build your data library
While you can add data later, you've been set up with a base set of data. Open the 0_SignalDataLibrary.py file
from the SampleSignal package and run  this. This will fatch and save a temporary version of the data to your
user directory under a series of folders nested under the .dataLib folder created above.

### Step 4: Make sure you can run Jupyter notebooks from within PyCharm
Although there are lots of potential ways you might use an IDE, a combination I like (and thus will impose upon you),
is the PyCharm IDE used in conjunction with a jupyter notebook to serve as a scratch pad.

First, go to your terminal/command line and enter "pipenv run jupyter notebook". If you installed Anaconda this should
instantiate and open a jupyter notebook for you in a browser.
