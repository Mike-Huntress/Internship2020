# Paolo's BW Internship 2020 Code

Hi! You're looking at my code. A few pointers around:

* The `SampleSignal` folder contains the Sample Signal code as well as my  work on the Data Exploration Questions.
* The `Indicators` folder has code for three separate indicators for bond movements (Inflation, Bond Demand, and Economic Growth), scratch Jupyter notebooks used for temporary work, and some Utilities to aid calculation.
